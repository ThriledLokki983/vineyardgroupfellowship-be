# Privacy App

## Purpose

GDPR compliance, consent management, and privacy controls for the Vineyard Group Fellowship
platform. Handles all legal requirements for data protection and user privacy
rights.

## Responsibilities

- **Consent Management**: Track privacy policy, terms of service, and data
  processing consent
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data export, deletion requests, and right to be forgotten
- **Privacy Preferences**: Profile visibility, contact preferences, and data
  retention settings
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable consent logs for legal compliance
- **Data Processing Records**: Transparency about data usage and retention

## Key Models

### **PrivacyProfile**

Core privacy and consent information extracted from the monolithic
authentication.UserProfile:

- Legal consent tracking (privacy policy, terms of service, data processing)
- Privacy preferences (profile visibility, contact preferences)
- Data retention preferences and auto-deletion settings
- Account deletion requests and GDPR rights management
- Anonymization preferences for posts and recovery data

### **ConsentLog**

Immutable audit trail for all consent-related actions:

- Detailed logging of consent given/withdrawn
- Version tracking for legal documents
- IP address and user agent logging for verification
- Expiration tracking for time-limited consent

### **DataProcessingRecord**

Transparency records for GDPR Article 13/14 compliance:

- Purpose and legal basis for data processing
- Data categories and retention periods
- Processing activity start/end dates
- Legal basis documentation (consent, contract, etc.)

## Origin - Model Split from Authentication

üîÑ **Phase 1 Refactoring**: This app was created to extract privacy and
GDPR-related functionality from the monolithic `authentication.UserProfile`
model.

**Fields Moved from UserProfile**:

- `privacy_policy_accepted` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.privacy_policy_accepted`
- `privacy_policy_accepted_at` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.privacy_policy_accepted_at`
- `privacy_policy_version` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.privacy_policy_version`
- `terms_of_service_accepted` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.terms_of_service_accepted`
- `data_processing_consent` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.data_processing_consent`
- `marketing_consent` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.marketing_consent`
- `profile_visibility` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.profile_visibility`
- `contact_preferences` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.contact_preferences`
- `deletion_requested` ‚Üí `PrivacyProfile.deletion_requested`
- All GDPR and consent-related fields

## GDPR Compliance Features

### **User Rights Implementation**

- ‚úÖ **Right to Information**: Data processing records show what data is
  processed and why
- ‚úÖ **Right of Access**: Data export functionality for user data portability
- ‚úÖ **Right to Rectification**: User can update privacy preferences and consent
- ‚úÖ **Right to Erasure**: Account deletion with configurable delay period
- ‚úÖ **Right to Restrict Processing**: Consent withdrawal stops non-essential
  processing
- ‚úÖ **Right to Data Portability**: JSON export of all user data
- ‚úÖ **Right to Object**: Granular consent controls for different processing
  purposes

### **Consent Management**

- **Granular Consent**: Separate tracking for different types of consent
- **Version Control**: Track which version of policies user consented to
- **Withdrawal Tracking**: Log when and why consent was withdrawn
- **Expiration Handling**: Automatic consent expiration for time-limited
  agreements

### **Data Retention**

- **Configurable Retention**: User can choose data retention periods
- **Auto-Deletion**: Automatic deletion after retention period expires
- **Anonymization Options**: Convert data to anonymous research data instead of
  deletion

## API Endpoints (Planned)

- `GET /api/v1/privacy/profile/` - Get privacy settings
- `PATCH /api/v1/privacy/profile/` - Update privacy preferences
- `POST /api/v1/privacy/consent/` - Give/withdraw specific consent
- `GET /api/v1/privacy/consent/log/` - View consent history
- `POST /api/v1/privacy/export/` - Request data export
- `POST /api/v1/privacy/delete/` - Request account deletion
- `DELETE /api/v1/privacy/delete/` - Cancel deletion request
- `GET /api/v1/privacy/processing/` - View data processing activities

## Business Logic

### Consent Workflows

- **Registration Flow**: Collect required consents during signup
- **Policy Updates**: Handle consent re-collection when policies change
- **Consent Withdrawal**: Graceful handling of consent withdrawal
- **Granular Control**: Allow users to consent to specific processing activities

### Privacy Controls

- **Visibility Settings**: Control who can see profile and recovery information
- **Contact Preferences**: Manage communication frequency and channels
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process necessary data

### GDPR Compliance

- **30-Day Deletion**: Standard 30-day delay for account deletion requests
- **Data Export**: Complete user data export in machine-readable format
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logs for all privacy-related actions
- **Legal Basis**: Document legal basis for all data processing activities

## Privacy Settings Hierarchy

### **Profile Visibility Levels**

1. **Private**: Only visible to the user themselves
2. **Friends**: Visible to accepted connections
3. **Community**: Visible to verified community members
4. **Public**: Visible to everyone (not recommended for recovery platform)

### **Recovery Info Visibility**

1. **Private**: Recovery information never shared
2. **Friends**: Shared with trusted connections only
3. **Supporters**: Shared with verified support providers
4. **Community**: Shared within recovery community

### **Contact Preferences**

1. **No Contact**: Emergency notifications only
2. **Email Only**: Critical platform updates via email
3. **Limited**: Important updates and security notifications
4. **Normal**: Regular platform communications
5. **All**: All notifications and marketing communications

## Security & Compliance

## Usage Examples

### Create Privacy Profile

```python
from privacy.models import PrivacyProfile

profile = PrivacyProfile.objects.create(
    user=user,
    profile_visibility='community',
    recovery_info_visibility='private',
    contact_preferences='normal'
)

# Accept privacy policy
profile.accept_privacy_policy('1.0')
profile.give_data_processing_consent()
```

### Log Consent Actions

```python
from privacy.models import ConsentLog

# Log consent given
ConsentLog.log_consent(
    user=user,
    consent_type='privacy_policy',
    given=True,
    version='1.0',
    ip_address=request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
)
```

### Request Account Deletion

```python
# Request deletion with 30-day delay
profile.request_deletion(delay_days=30)

# Cancel deletion request
profile.cancel_deletion_request()
```

### Data Processing Transparency

```python
from privacy.models import DataProcessingRecord

# Record data processing activity
record = DataProcessingRecord.objects.create(
    user=user,
    purpose='recovery_support',
    data_categories='["recovery_stage", "sobriety_date", "goals"]',
    legal_basis='consent',
    retention_period_days=1095  # 3 years
)
```

## Testing Requirements

- Test consent workflow completeness
- Verify GDPR compliance for all user rights
- Test data export functionality
- Validate deletion request handling
- Test privacy visibility controls
- Verify audit log immutability

## Performance Considerations

- Index on user fields for fast profile lookups
- Efficient queries for consent status checks
- Optimize privacy visibility filtering
- Cache privacy settings for frequent access
- Batch process deletion requests

## Migration Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Migration Required**: When deploying, existing
`authentication.UserProfile` privacy data needs to be migrated to
`PrivacyProfile`.

**Migration Strategy**:

1. Create new `PrivacyProfile` records for all users
2. Copy privacy-related fields from `UserProfile`
3. Create initial `ConsentLog` entries for existing consents
4. Validate data integrity and consent completeness
5. Remove old privacy fields from `UserProfile` (Phase 2)
